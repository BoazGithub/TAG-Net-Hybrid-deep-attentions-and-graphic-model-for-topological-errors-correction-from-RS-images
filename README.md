# TAG-Net-Hybrid-deep-attentions-and-graphic-model-for-topological-errors-correction-from-RS-images
The brief contribution of this study, is to address the integration of deep learning capabilities in correction of road network topological errors which usually developed during road extraction.  This serves purpose of proper integration of all land uses spatial coverage statistics.
