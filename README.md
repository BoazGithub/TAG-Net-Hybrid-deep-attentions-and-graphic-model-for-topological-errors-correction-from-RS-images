# <h1 align="center"> <b>TAG-Para: Hybrid deep attentions and graphical representations for Roads’ network topological error correction</b><br></h1>
 
The brief contribution of this study is to address the integration of deep learning capabilities in the correction of road network topological errors, which usually develop during road extraction.  This serves the purpose of proper integration of all land-use spatial coverage statistics. I present a comprehensive study on the proposed TAG-Net “topological attention graphical model for road semantic segmentation with Gating signals on the network middle block and attention-based mechanism on the decoder side for spatial resolution recovery, mainly focusing on features to extract. We designed this model to serve and stand out from the crowd in the deep learning and geospatial or spatial planning fields. The findings have the potential to advance our understanding of how multimodal fusion can be applied in various practical applications, such as large-scale land cover mapping.

## Optimization under Bayesian
Portrays the variations in uncertainty levels, which means the
colors on the 3D surface change as nodal premixed move down along the
the figure, indicating variations in uncertainty levels.

The full, medium, and partial dependency plot displays 3D surface probabilities plots encompassing all combinations of explored hyper-parameters tuned during Bayesian optimization and it illustrates all the levels of nodal proximity uncertainty. This demonstrates how the estimated fitness value alters when we manipulate three-dimensional metrics concurrently. The subplots positioned at the top illustrate the impact of an individual dimension on accuracy. Within each subplot, the black-blue and yellow-black regions delineate areas corresponding to low and high performing hyper-parameters, respectively, as nodes are optimized. The black surface indicates where the optimizer has sampled the hyper-parameter space, while the red dot denotes the lowest hyper-parameters identified which significantly demonstrates large error topological error, and Varying this parameter creates different beliefs about how quickly F(b) changes with nodal connection).

# TAG-Para Network model complexity
Proposed TAG-Net, which amalgamates the Attention parallel ViT training-based model named para learning,

distinguishes itself from other models susceptible to convolution operation challenges during spatial resolution restoration in downsampled features due to the RRB modules together with the Parzen Tree Estimator, which optimizes hyper-parameters to increase the connectivity of disconnected road nodes. We
also employed various post-processing techniques to correct identified errors, such as It’s imperative to highlight that the effectiveness of TAG-ParaNet for correcting road network topological errors.
