# <h1 align="center"> <b>TAG-Para: Hybrid deep attentions and graphical representations for Roads’ network topological error correction</b><br></h1>
 
The brief contribution of this study is to address the integration of deep learning capabilities in the correction of road network topological errors, which usually develop during road extraction.  This serves the purpose of proper integration of all land-use spatial coverage statistics. I present a comprehensive study on the proposed TTAG-Net “topological attention graphical model for road semantic segmentation with Gating signals on the network middle block and attention-based mechanism on the decoder side for spatial resolution recovery, mainly focusing on features to extract. We designed this model to serve and stand out from the crowd in the deep learning and geospatial or spatial planning fields. The findings have the potential to advance our understanding of how multimodal fusion can be applied in various practical applications, such as large-scale land cover mapping.
